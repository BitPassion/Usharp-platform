# USharp

TODO: Explain what this project is (roughly speaking it's similar to mono-ue except with a thinner C++ layer and supports both mono and the microsoft .NET framework - the equivalent mono-ue backend stuff here is written in C# - see https://github.com/pixeltris/USharp/tree/master/UnrealEngine.Runtime/UnrealEngine.Runtime/Internal)

This adapts various parts of mono-ue https://mono-ue.github.io/
